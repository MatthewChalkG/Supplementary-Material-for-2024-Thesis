# Supplementary-Material-for-2024-Thesis
Supplementary material for my 2024 Mudd physics thesis work involving studying a novel method of functionalizing graphene. Electrical measurement code, Kicad files for new PCB designs, SolidWorks CAD of the cryostat, and device modeling with COMSOL and python are included.
This repository contains the supplementary material for my thesis. Included is the code I wrote for taking electrical measurements in the PPMS at Caltech as well as photovoltaic measurements in the optical cryostat at Mudd. Databases files containing the data are too big to upload, but are available upon reasonable request (as permission from my PI). In addition, KiCad files for the redesigned PCBs for the optical cryostat (chip carrier and chip carrier receptacle are also contained in this database). SolidWorks CAD of the optical cryostat I functionalized is in this repository. In addition, device modeling done with COMSOL and python are in here as well.
