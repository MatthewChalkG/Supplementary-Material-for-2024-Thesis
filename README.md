# Supplementary-Material-for-2024-Thesis
Supplementary material for my 2024 Mudd physics thesis work involving studying a novel method of functionalizing graphene. Electrical measurement codes, Kicad files for new PCB designs, and CAD of the cryostat are included.
This repository contains the supplementary material for my thesis. Included is the code I wrote for taking electrical measurements in the PPMS at Caltech as well as photovoltaic measurements in the optical cryostat at Mudd. Databases files containing the data are too big to upload, but are available upon reasonable request. In addition, KiCad files for the redesigned PCBs for the optical cryostat (chip carrier and chip carrier receptacle are also contained in this database). Finally, CAD of the optical cryostat I functionalized is also in this repository.
